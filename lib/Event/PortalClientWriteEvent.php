/**
 * Portaliq PortalClientWriteEvent
 *
 * The `portal.write.client` fact: a citizen wrote something on their own case
 * through the portal. Portaliq is the SOURCE here, so the class lives in
 * Portaliq's namespace and the case app listens for it (ADR-041's conclusion
 * shape: provenance plus an outcome envelope, no result slot, because nothing
 * is being asked of the listener).
 *
 * It exists so a rule can fire on "de indiener heeft gereageerd" without
 * guessing from the actor. A staff write never travels this path: the internal
 * write does not pass through the portal at all, and no other portaliq code
 * dispatches this event.
 *
 * A case app binds the listener by class name, which PHP resolves without
 * autoloading, so a case app keeps working with Portaliq absent (ADR-046).
