 * Portaliq PortalClientWithdrawalEvent
 *
 * An applicant ending their own request from the portal. It is its own event,
 * not a status change that happens to look like one: a rule that should fire
 * when a citizen withdraws must not also fire when a handler sets the same
 * status internally, and the only way to tell those apart is to raise this
 * from the portal path alone.
