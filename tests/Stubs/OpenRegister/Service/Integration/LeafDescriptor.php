/**
 * LeafDescriptor — the server-side declaration a sibling app contributes when
 * it registers a leaf on OpenRegister objects through
 * `RegisterLeafProvidersEvent`.
 *
 * A leaf has two faces: a render surface (a tab/widget mounted by the app's own
 * Vue bundle) and/or a data provider (read/append data served from the app's own
 * store). This descriptor carries the availability + capability metadata for
 * both faces — it deliberately carries NO Vue components: render components are
 * supplied on the JS layer under the same `id`, and the descriptor `id` MUST
 * equal the JS registration id so the two layers correlate (ADR-019 parity).
 *
 * The descriptor is render-and-read only by construction (ADR-066): it exposes
 * no verb, command, or handler. Cross-app commands stay ADR-041 typed events.
